Starting this photography hobby has pushed me to go out more — further afield, off my usual paths.

>It’s also had a surprising effect: I’m more aware of *things*.

A *thing* could be any***thing*** — but I’ve started noticing framing, composition, and the mood of a view. I don’t just think *“oh look, a tree”* anymore. I see how that tree stands in its space, how it frames the scene, how it affects the feeling of what’s around it.


However this hobby turns out - I’m out more, and I’m noticing things I wouldn’t have before. That’s enough for now.s
