So, a new experience is coming up soon. I was awarded a travel grant (that's a new one by itself). I am going to Stavanger, Norway, as part of my research studies. This would be my first ***real*** trip alone - no one but myself.

Hopefully, it's a success...

Speaking of success, I tend to ask myself: *what will success look like?* Will it be some tangible result of my research? Or will it just be some photos I am happy with. As with everything, the answer is probably in the middle.

*Worst case, I get lost in Norway with a camera. Could be worse.*
